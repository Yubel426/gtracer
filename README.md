# 3D Gaussian Ray Tracer

An OptiX-based differentiable 3D Gaussian Ray Tracer, inspired by the work "3D Gaussian Ray Tracing: Fast Tracing of Particle Scenes" (https://gaussiantracer.github.io/).

### Install
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/fudan-zvg/gtracer.git
cd gtracer

# use cmake to build the project for ptx file (for Optix)
rm -rf ./build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ../

# Install the package
pip install .
```

### Example usage
```bash
cd example
# Interactive viewer for 3DGS format point cloud
python renderer.py -p point_cloud.ply
```
